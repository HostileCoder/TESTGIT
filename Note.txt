Neural Networks, Hypersurfaces, and the Generalized Radon Transform 

	Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have long been used as a mathematical 
	modeling method and have recently found numerous applications in science and technology, 
	including computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning [1], to name a few. 
	Although notable function approximation results exist [2], theoretical explanations have 
	yet to catch up with newer developments, particularly with regard to (deep) hierarchical
	learning. As a consequence, numerous doubts often accompany NN practitioners, such as 	 
	How many layers should one use? What is the effect of different activation functions?	 
	What are the effects of pooling? and many others. Â© 1991-2012 IEEE.

Machine learning-based signal degradation models for attenuated underwater optical communication OAM beams
	Orbital Angular Momentum
 	
	OAM communications have great potential in free space or underwater
 	environments to increase communication bandwidth by multiplexing modes together. 

	OAM underwater optical communication approach was implemented using 16 spatial modes 
	
	The analysis provided in this paper focuses on the classification of these modes as an 
	important step to full implementation of an underwater OAM system
